# odin-recipes

This is a simple project from The Odin Project curriculum.  
The goal of this project is to build a basic recipe website using only HTML.  

By completing this project, I will demonstrate the following skills:
- Structuring content with HTML
- Working with lists, links, and images
- Using Git and GitHub to manage a project

This is a foundational step in my web development journey.
